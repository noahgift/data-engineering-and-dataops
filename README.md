## **Requirements**



* Distroless AWS Lambda: Your project should effectively use Distroless AWS Lambda functions for data processing. This involves including a Dockerfile that uses the Distroless container format. Distroless containers contain only your application and its runtime dependencies. They do not contain package managers, shells or any other programs in a standard Linux distribution.
* AWS Step Functions: Include AWS Step Functions to orchestrate your data pipeline.
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use an IaC solution such as AWS CloudFormation, AWS SAM, or AWS CDK for provisioning and managing your AWS resources. The deployment process should be set up as "continuous delivery," meaning it is automatically deployed on changes either through GitHub Actions or AWS CodeBuild.
* A README.md file: This should clearly explain what the project does, its dependencies, how to run the program, and conclude with actionable and data-driven recommendations to a hypothetical management team.
* Video Demo: A YouTube link in README.md showing a clear, concise walkthrough and demonstration of your data pipeline, including the automated trigger and recommendations to the management team.


## **Grading Rubric**

Your project will be graded on the following criteria:



* **Distroless AWS Lambda (30 points)**: Your AWS Lambda functions should effectively process data using a distroless runtime. Include a Dockerfile that uses the Distroless container format and passes Hadolint, a Dockerfile linter.
    * Proper usage of distroless AWS Lambda: 15 points
    * Effective data processing: 15 points
* **AWS Step Functions (30 points)**: Your project should use AWS Step Functions to orchestrate the data pipeline correctly.
    * Correct orchestration of AWS Step Functions: 15 points
    * Effective data pipeline workflow: 15 points
* **Infrastructure as Code (20 points)**: Use an IaC solution for provisioning and managing your AWS resources. The deployment process should be set up as "continuous delivery."
    * Proper usage of IaC (AWS CloudFormation, AWS SAM, or AWS CDK): 10 points
    * Implementation of continuous delivery deployment: 10 points
* **README.md (10 points)**: The README.md file should clearly explain the project, guide the user on how to run the program, and conclude with an actionable and data-driven recommendation for a management team.
    * Clarity and completeness of README: 5 points
    * Quality of conclusion and recommendation: 5 points
* **Video Demo (10 points):** A 2-5 minute video explaining the project and demonstrating its functionality should be included. The video should be high-quality (both audio and visual), not exceed the given time limit, and be linked in the README via a private or public YouTube link.
    * Clarity of explanation: 3 points
    * Quality demonstration of the project: 3 points
    * Quality of video and audio: 4 points


## Total: 100 points


## Requirements

Your team project should include the following:



* Microservice
    * Build a microservice that interfaces with a data pipeline. You can choose Python or Rust for development. The microservice should include logging and be containerized using the Distroless Docker image. A Dockerfile must be included in your repository.
* Load Test
    * The microservice must be capable of handling 10,000 requests per second. A load test verifying this performance should be included.
* Data Engineering
    * Your project should involve the use of a library specializing in data engineering such as Spark, Pandas, SQL, a vector database, or any other relevant library.
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
    * Your project must utilize an IaC solution for infrastructure setup and management. You can choose among AWS CloudFormation, AWS SAM, AWS CDK, or the Serverless Framework.
* Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
    * Implement a CI/CD pipeline for your project. It could be through GitHub Actions or AWS Cloud Build or any other relevant tool.
* README.md
    * A comprehensive README file that clearly explains what the project does, its dependencies, how to run the program, its limitations, potential areas for improvement, and how AI Pair Programming tools (GitHub Copilot and one more tool of your choice) were used in your development process.
* Architectural Diagram
    * A clear diagram representing the architecture of your application should be included in your project documentation.
* GitHub Configurations
    * Your GitHub repository must include GitHub Actions and a .devcontainer configuration for GitHub Codespaces. This should make the local version of your project completely reproducible. The repository should also include GitHub Action build badges for install, lint, test, and format actions.
* Teamwork Reflection
    * Each team member should submit a separate 1-2 page management report reflecting on the team's functioning according to the principles discussed in your teamwork book. This report should not be part of the GitHub README but rather a separate document. It should include a peer evaluation in which each team member is graded on their performance, stating three positive attributes and three areas for improvement as the basis for the grade. Note that each student will share the teamwork reflection with their team and discuss it in a session before turning in the report. The outcome of this feedback session must be included in the report for full credit.
* Quantitative Assessment
    * The project must include a quantitative assessment of its reliability and stability. You must use data science fundamentals to describe system performance, e.g., average latency per request at different levels of requests per second (100, 1000, etc.). Think of the software system as a data science problem that needs to be described using data science principles.
* Demo Video
    * A YouTube link in README.md showing a clear, concise walkthrough and demonstration of your application, including the load test and system performance assessment.
* Team Size and Makeup
    * The team should consist of 3-4 people, ideally composed of 1-2 strong programmers and 1-2 quantitative storytellers.
