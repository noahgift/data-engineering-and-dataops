### Course Description

This course covers servers as a method of encapsulating many courses in the program.  Students learn to apply Data Engineering to a real-world project.  This manifests itself through several goals:  development of non-linear life-long learning, community building, portfolio development, and software engineering best practices.

## Course Objectives

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

* Develop Data Engineering applications and apply DataOps methodology
* Use software development best practices to create data engineering applications. These will include continuous deployment, code quality tools, logging, instrumentation, and monitoring.
* Use cloud-native technologies to perform data engineering.
* Develop non-linear life-long learning skills
* Build, share and present compelling portfolios using:  Github, YouTube, and Linkedin.
* Successfully engage in and build a community of like-minded professionals
* Get Certified both Cloud Computing and a Big Data SQL solution

### Prerequisites 

Basic programming skills as well as basic linux skills.  See optional readings/media to self-learn before class starts.

### Diversity Statement

As educators and learners, we must share a commitment to diversity and equity, removing barriers to education so that everyone may participate fully in the community. In this course, we respect and embrace the unique experiences that brought each person here, including backgrounds, identities, learning styles, ways of expression, and academic interests. The broad spectrum of perspectives represented by our students enrich everyone’s experiences, and we strive to meet each perspective with openness and respect.

#### Late Work Policy 

Late work will be accepted only in the event of an instructor-approved absence. Contact your instructor as soon as possible, at least 24 hours in advance.

### Online Communication and Interaction Expectations
#### Discussion Forums 

The purpose of the discussion boards is to allow students to freely exchange ideas. It is imperative to remain respectful of all viewpoints and positions and, when necessary, agree to respectfully disagree. While active and frequent participation is encouraged, cluttering a discussion board with inappropriate, irrelevant, or insignificant material will not earn additional points and may result in receiving less than full credit. Frequency matters, but contributing content that adds value is paramount. Please remember to cite all sources—when relevant—in order to avoid plagiarism. Please post your viewpoints first and then discuss others’ viewpoints. 

The quality of your posts and how others view and respond to them are the most valued. A single statement mostly implying “I agree” or “I do not agree” is not counted as a post. Explain, clarify, politely ask for details, provide details, persuade, and enrich communications for a great discussion experience. Please note, there is a requirement to respond to at least two fellow class members’ posts. Also, remember to cite all sources—when relevant—in order to avoid plagiarism.

#### Online Communication Etiquette

Beyond interacting with your instructor and peers in discussions, you will be expected to communicate by Canvas message, email, and sync session. Your instructor may also make themselves available by phone or text. In all contexts, keep your communication professional and respect the instructor’s posted availability. 

Just as you expect a response when you send a message to your instructor, please respond promptly when your instructor contacts you. Your instructor will expect a response within two business days. This will require that you log into the course site regularly and set up your notifications to inform you when the instructor posts an announcement, provides feedback on work or sends you a message. 

#### Participation and Attendance 

This course will not meet at a particular time each week. All course goals, session learning objectives, and assessments are supported through classroom elements that can be accessed at any time. To measure class participation (or attendance), your participation in threaded discussion boards is required, graded, and paramount to your success in this course. Please note that any scheduled synchronous meetings are optional. While your attendance is highly encouraged, it is not required and you will not be graded on your attendance or participation.
